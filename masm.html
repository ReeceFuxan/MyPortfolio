        <p>While taking a course over MASM and machine language we ran into an issue being able to run the assembly language programs on our laptops. I teamed up with another student in the class and we were able to figure out the issue was with the virus protection systems everyone had on their computers. The virus [protection had completely blocked all Irvine and .asm programs, viewing them at threats. After a lot of time and research we were able to come up with a solution. We embeded the MASM coding programs into Microsoft Visual Studios so that the virus protection would not scan them and we were successfully about to run all the programs and assignmemts. We then wrote up a detailed solution and walkthrough to be able to show our classmates and our professor how they can also use Visual Studios to run the programs despite the increased virus security.</p>
